            <h3>Reflections:</h3>
            <p>

Today was a rather social day. I spent most of my time talking with people, which made me a bit tired. Even though some wanted to keep talking into the night, I decided to retire. 

I have decided I will remove the training rule of meditating for two daily hours. I practice Dhamma for more than 2 hours daily through walking meditation, sitting meditation, chanting, studying the suttas, and studying Pāli. I believe the training rule is limiting, as reflecting on suttas and chanting is even more useful than meditation, depending on the circumstances. For example, now that I’m undergoing questioning and incorporating active reflection on my practice, which I have not done before, I find that sitting to meditate 2 hours daily might not be the most profitable way to spend my time. It’s much more beneficial to study the suttas and do some chanting. Meditation comes whenever it does. I already know that I will spend over 2 hours practising Dhamma in some way or another, so it’s not a rule I need. Therefore, I have removed it. 

I followed the training precepts today. I still have some feelings of sadness, melancholy, and a slight anxiety. If I started to use entertainment again, within a couple of days, these feelings would diminish greatly. I know that because I have done it before. But then again, entertainment would become unengaging, and I would feel empty and unfulfilled. Entertainment, quite simply, doesn’t work. Therefore, I’m making efforts towards staying with those feelings, which are the same feelings that came up quite some years ago during the depression. I want to know them; that is my goal. The pressure in the middle of my forehead, between my eyes, had disappeared for the past few days, maybe the past week, but now it has returned. It is not strong but already quite noticeable.
