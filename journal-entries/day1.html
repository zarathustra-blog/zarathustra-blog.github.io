            <h3>Reflections:</h3>
            <p>
                Having renounced to entertainment, there is more space for Dhamma. Doing the laundry, cleaning the floor and windows, and going to the bathroom become moments of silence. However, when the mind doesn’t consume content, it creates content on its own, through imagination and thinking. 

                It seems to me the renunciation must be in two ways. Firstly, it is external and applicable through restraint: I renounce going to shows, listening to music, and watching videos, for example, and I can achieve that by restraining myself. That is good but I have learned it is not very long term. I have spent many weeks with this type of renunciation and afterward have always gone back to escaping discomfort through online entertainment. So, for me, it is very important to renounce also in the second sense: internally and achievable through mindfulness and wisdom. That is, renouncing the notion that time is to be passed and discomforts to be escaped by seeking pleasure. It is not only that I will not access some streaming platform, for example, but that I will again and again see it for what it is: a place of temporary escape, of a virtual false world that cannot provide me satisfaction, filled with lies, banality, and delusion. And it’s not about cleaning the house without headphones but with the mind scattered all over, but instead to persistently and patiently bringing myself back to the silence, the tranquillity, the truth. 

                Today it has been helpful to think about these actions as an offer. I honour every moment and offer my attention to each one because that to which we pay attention is what we become. Therefore, may truth become. May love become. May we all be happy until there is no more becoming.

            <h3>Visuddhimagga  Study:</h3>
            <p>
                I have attended a Dhamma group study session. We have started Chapter XVIII <i> Other Recollections as Meditation Subjects</i> and have finished on paragraph 27 “As to the Frailty of Life.”.

Maraṇasati is a Samatha practice consisting in remembering that death is bound to come. It is not Vipassana, and therefore the aim is not to understand momentary death—that is, the deeper truth of anicca—but instead to obtain tranquillity of the mind and disenchantment with the worldly conditions. It can lead to access concentration and prepare the mind for working with Vipassana afterwards.

The recollection of death can be as simple as being aware of its fact, continually repeating “I shall die,” or remembering it through metaphors.


            <blockquote class="custom-quote"> 
                "Therefore, just as the risen sun moves on towards its setting and never turns back even for a little while from wherever it has got to, or just as a mountain torrent sweeps by with a rapid current, ever flowing and rushing on and never turning back even for a little while, so too this living being travels on towards death from the time when he is born, and he never turns back even for a little while." 
                <footer>Vis.XVII.11</footer> 
            </blockquote>


Further on, it is also stated that death is bound to come “as vanishing is to dewdrops touched by the sun’s ray.”

We went through four specific ways in which we can recollect death.

<ul>

<li><u>The appearance of a murderer:</u> A murderer “carries off life and never returns to bring it back.” In the same way, death comes to us. </li>

<li><u>Ruining success:</u> “Success does not exist that might endure out of reach of failure.” Similarly, there is no way to live a life that goes out of reach of death. </li>

<li><u>Comparison:</u> People of great fame, merit, strength, supernormal powers, understanding, Paccekabuddhas, and fully Enlightened Buddhas have all died. I shall die as well. I often feel enchanted by intellectual achievements and developing my understanding, losing sight of the fact that it similarly leads to death. All people that I admire have or will die, just like I shall do. Everything they have discovered and written will be forgotten. Therefore, I strive for the ultimate goal and let understanding and merits come on their own accord. It is only the molasses of the factory of sugar. </li>

<li><u>Sharing the body with many:</u>We share the body with microorganisms, worms, viruses, illnesses, and other creatures. They also have power over our body and may cause its death. Many creatures are born, grow, and die in the body. We don’t have complete control over this body, and one day, it will die </li>
