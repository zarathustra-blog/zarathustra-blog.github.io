The day today went by like it does in a retreat: through an eternal present. Each moment seems everlasting, and yet it feels like only a few moments ago I was here writing yesterday’s journal entry. It also feels like I renounced entertainment at least a few weeks ago; mentally, I have disconnected from it. Today I followed all the rules, including eating in one session, but I ate twice. It has to be like this twice a week because I do physical exercise at work Monday and Wednesday and I feel too weak if I don’t eat something afterwards. But luckily, even at work, I can eat in one session, silently and with mindfulness. I’m feeling blessed.

Today was not a very productive day. I didn’t study at all. I feel grateful because it was a day with more mindfulness, although I did loose at least a couple of hours checking emails, notifications, and so on, and did so in a rather aimless manner. I am confident in Dhamma, and my mind is best when on the path. So, tomorrow I shall find the focus to study more. And even if that's not the case, my trust and purpose are on the path. The attitude is that of being willing to sacrifice everything, although until now, of course, I have sacrificed nothing. On the contrary, I have received too much to say.

Therefore, a reflection for today would be the times to check on emails, notifications, and other small daily tasks that may come up. It would be best to find a specific time for such things and never delay neither meditation nor study sessions to do them; otherwise, I get too caught up. I have been living on the road for some time now and have habitutated to do these type of things as soon as possible. But now I have the advantages of routine and stability; I have regular access to the Internet, food, and safety. I can delay them for later. This will help me become calmer and quieter.

May Dhamma shine brightly tomorrow and ever after.
