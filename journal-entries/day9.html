            <h3>Reflections:</h3>
            <p>

Today was upbeat and lively. The tide of lethargy from the past couple of days has passed, and now a new one comes. Yesterday, just before meditation, I wrote, “I’ve been asleep all day, and only now I awaken. I’ve been asleep for three days in fact, probably more. […] I feel that I awake as I write this, just as if I were coming out of a dream, less and less confused by it, with reality becoming more and more concrete. Where was I? What is this deep, thick black lake into which I just took a dip?” And indeed, during writing and afterwards, I felt free from the sadness and apathy that had been pushing me down. This morning, I woke up clearly, feeling rested after not too many hours of sleep. Meditation was smooth and calming, and the rest of the day has followed similarly. Looking back, it seems clear in which moments I was equanimous and in which not, to which extent I was aware of anatta, and to which extent, which was and is the largest, I’m not.

Today when I left work, the person in charge said, “Bye, see you,” and unexpectedly my heart opened beyond the reach of the mind. As I was coming back through the darkness in the bus, warmed by a jacket I was given a few days ago, my mind was blissfully empty. Despite it all, there was some wisdom in the discomfort, so may there be wisdom in the comfort now.
