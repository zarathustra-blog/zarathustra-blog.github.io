            <h3>Reflections:</h3>
            <p>

Today we took a work trip. I spent the vast majority of the day in social conditions and broke two of the training rules. Firstly, I did not eat in one single session but in at least five—one of which was a main meal and four of which were snacks. I ate too much, and therefore the evening meditation is not very comfortable. I ate the main meal with other people, and although we were silent for most of the time, I engaged in conversation and abstained from reciting anything before eating. I believe that to be appropriate, but eating snacks—most specifically, the two portions of cake—can be reflected upon. In the bodily regard, it is not an issue because I have been losing weight recently, but there was definitely also some craving. I don’t think I would be unhappy if the snacks were not offered again, so perhaps the craving was not so strong. Overall, I do not consider it a big breakage of the precepts and believe that as a layperson, one must adapt with flexibility to social and work situations.

However, the other breakage of the precept is something I regret more deeply: I lied. I did not tell the truth. I was relating an anecdote about an activity that I did some years ago and did not explain it according to the facts. It was absurd; nobody cared, but still I told things that were not true to make it look like I had paid less money than I actually did to do that activity. I have told this lie at least once before, and when I said I had done that activity, I naturally also said that I had found a way not to pay so much for it, which is false. The moment I realized I was saying it, I completely stopped. However, I did not say something along the lines of “forgive me, but actually I did pay for the full price for that activity.” Instead, I changed the subject. I’m happy that I realized almost immediately that I was lying and stopped, but a more skillful course of action upon realizing it would have been to clarify what is true and what is untrue, instead of letting others believe both. Hopefully that is the choice I make next time.

The reason for lying is an attachment to the concept of "I,” which I want others to perceive in a certain way. In this case, I wanted to make myself look casual and carefree—a self, that is, of over 5 years ago, from which most cells don't even remain—and reinforce the idea that one can travel without a lot of money. But I’m not always detached: sometimes there is coolness and sometimes excitement, and I have craved for special activities and places, believing they would change me, which has made me willing to spend on them larger amounts of money. There is nothing to hide; conditions arise and pass without any need for us to make stories about them. But today I didn’t see this clearly, and that brought me to lie. May I act more skillfully the next time. 

I did follow the rest of the training rules, although there is another thing to reflect on. On the work trip, there was about an hour bus ride, which we mostly took in silence. As I had a Dhamma talk on my phone, I started listening to it but had to pause Ajahn midway because we arrived before the talk finished. I didn’t like to have to stop the talk, and in general it didn't seem respectful. I observed this and yet played it again on the way back, although I was aware I would still not have time to finish it. I think listening to a Dhamma talk during a journey can be good, because sometimes it’s possible to focus all the attention on it, but I should not start listening if I think I may not have time to finish it. I like to treat such occasions respectfully so that I can become more aware of the joy and rarity that is to listen to Dhamma. And, in any case, a journey can also be taken in silence, and that is sometimes the most powerful Dhamma talk—with the deepest respects to all teachers.

No more reflections for today. Tomorrow is likely to be a social day as well. May I be more wise in my interactions so that I don’t harm others and I don’t harm myself. May there be only love, kindness, and honesty until we reach Nibbāna.
