            <h3>Reflections:</h3>
            <p>

I have broken two training precepts. Regarding food, I didn’t eat only in one session. I had agreed to talk with some friends shortly after my meal, and even though I would have time to finish eating mindfully and do the recitation, I didn’t. Instead, I was stopping the meal halfway and attempting to finish some tasks on my laptop. Afterwards, in the evening, I ate again while chatting, distracted and without reflecting whether I needed the food or not.

Perhaps more importantly, I meditated for only 45 minutes in the morning. I spent the full day doing chores and going out with people. I had a total of about 2 to 3 hours of time alone throughout the day and spent them doing some tasks on my laptop, which were not necessarily urgent. Next time, I want to prioritise the training rules, as they are the fundamental tasks upon which everything else is built.

On a positive note, I was more skilled regarding talking. I was aware of what I was saying and when, with awareness of whether I was hiding or exaggerating something. I told my two roommates about why I’m here and that I’m contemplating either becoming a monk or a hermit. We didn’t go into too many details—they didn’t ask further—but I’m glad that I can open myself and let them know the things that are important in my life. At some point, I exaggerated something, but I realised immediately and rectified. 

Some days like this are bound to happen. It’s good to socialise openly and keep track of friends, so I will accept this kind of invitation in the future. A lay life is filled with distractions, so may I be able to use them to continue on growing by knowing what to focus on and understanding which things can lead to satisfaction and which lead only to dukkha. May I continue to grow in both smooth and difficult days until I attain Nibbana.
