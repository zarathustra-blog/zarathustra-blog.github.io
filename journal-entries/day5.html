            <h3>Reflections:</h3>
            <p>

Well, this is what I wanted, so I guess I’m in the perfect position. Something has been coming up on the surface, although for now I’m unsure as to what. It seems that for the moment it is partly a feeling of tension, very clearly felt between my eyes but present to some degree all throughout my head. There is also a feeling of lethargy. I don’t feel energetic or motivated to do anything. And, of course, there has been regularly a feeling of sadness. Those things are noticeably present when I’m alone and a little bit more hidden when I’m with other people. All of this means the training precepts are at least partly working; they are having their effect.

Mentally, all these sensations often have been expressing themselves as thoughts; that is a heavy pattern of mine, but the novelty is that they have taken the shape of doubt (for lack of a better word). It is not that I doubt the precepts or the path; I have deep faith in it, but I doubt as to whether I can make any progress and whether I am using my time in the best way. The doubt is also introspective: was I ever really committed, will I ever be happy, have I been traveling to run away from something, etc. Some are slightly insightful, but most are simply confusion, which spread over my eyes like a thick paste. It is not extremely uncomfortable, but the equanimity has not been shaking much for now. Only in the morning it was weaker, but it got increasingly steady as the day went by.

I feel strongly committed to the precepts now, although in the morning the thought did come that I didn’t want to meditate at all. I still did it and meditated without trouble for the hour, but the thought was there. However, I still feel a senselessness and purposelessness, which I know no amount of reading, traveling, or speech can evade. It is something symptomatic, a feeling part of some large ignorance or defilement; I’m unsure what exactly.

In terms of productivity, I have been inefficient to quite an extreme. I will be behind schedule on my studies in just a couple of days if the situation continues like this. Regarding work, it has not had major effects, although there are moments where my lethargy or sadness shines through and makes me be rather apathic. I’m also far more sensitive, and especially if people are talking about their emotions, which happens rather often, I can feel what they are describing all through my body. This makes me feel connected to them, but in my situation right now, I’m not able to practice strong Metta.

No matter the cost, I will go on. Because this is the only thing worth doing. Because there was never anything else to do. Because there is not rest, no refuge, and no safety until we reach Nibbāna.
