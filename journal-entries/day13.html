            <h3>Reflections:</h3>
            <p>

The days has gone on with some sadness but lesser intensity. I spoke to my mother for over 4 hours about recent developments as well as more trivial matters. I then socialized talking past midnight. I also watched a documentary in the middle of these two things, and although I reflected that I was doing it for distraction, which is to say, delusion, I didnâ€™t have the clarity to know what that meant, I therefore watched it anyway. This really made my mind more unstable, I become unaware and afterwards I just wanted grosser forms of distraction, just as music. I did follow the training rules.
