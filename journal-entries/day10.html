            <h3>Reflections:</h3>
            <p>

       Today marks the tenth day I've been following the training precepts, and it was unfortunately not a day where I followed all of them. I missed one: the two hours of daily meditation. I have not completed them both. 

I received some new information today regarding my possible (or not) ordination, and it was rather mixed. As the day progresses, my mind has inclined towards interpreting it as bad news. Of course, I can't know what my mind will make of it tomorrow. The only thing which remains is the Dhamma and the avijjā, the saṃsāra and the sāsana. But, as many times before, I haven't been able to see that, and instead of trusting the heart and sitting down to listen to it, I have trusted the mind and have followed it to all its occurrences and explorations. Now, I'm left with more thoughts but not with more wisdom. And that is an exchange that I must never be willing to make. 

I surprisingly don't feel too agitated, although some anxiety is there. For the most part, I feel sad. It's not about anything in particular but simply about the condition we find ourselves in and how difficult it is to escape all this suffering. How much it sticks to our hearts like slime so that the more we attempt to take it away, the more of a mess we make. And instead of getting together and letting the heart grow free from it, we have to make so many rules. I guess sadness does make me a bit too sensitive. 

In any case, I'm also gaining detachment. I shared some of what I wrote the night when I was feeling sad, some two or three days ago, and now I may share some more, as it is related to what has transpired today: 

"I'm afraid, yes, of both succeeding and failing. That brings me to a stop, movement becomes impossible, and anxiety takes a spin, trying to take the wheel. But the block continues and stillness often can result in sadness. And sadness, in turn, can lead to wisdom, which brings me finally to this paper and, after three days, out of a dream. For how long, I cannot say; the war hasn't been won, it might even be that this battle has been lost. [...] Each moment there is less and less of an I, I am disintegrating in each step I walk. What else is there to do? These worldly pursuits hold me in so lightly I feel as if one day I might wake up and realize they are gone. But oh, how fear attacks then! How ego revolts! How Māra attempts to find anything! It is even pitying the excruciating efforts we make not to wake up, all the while as we say we are attempting to do so. I definitely put a lot of effort into not waking up, much more than in doing so. If I wasn't, all these issues would have been resolved long ago: all the ramblings, all the loneliness, all the excitement and the inevitable subsequent crash. As I write, I feel now I dance around the topic; my fingers don't want to reveal it all, don't want my mind to know just how simple everything was, how painfully deluded I am. I pray for help from all those who can help me. It cannot be said that I didn't try. It's such a long journey. Each time I've caught myself hiding away, rejecting truth, every single time I have put the utmost effort in stopping those attempts, before and after Dhamma. I try now as well, perhaps more out of habit than wisdom. And for my efforts, I've been rewarded immensely, although, of course, nothing can save me from myself. [...]. Problems will never end, they will just keep on coming. Let them be! What did they ever have to do with Dhamma? What did they ever have to do with a solution? No, problems are only problems, and to more problems they lead. A solution is something else entirely and is found only in a completely different way. May there be Dhamma because I never was. I and the dissatisfaction entangled viscously. I am condemned to keep trying until I learn not to [...]."

With this, I will meditate for a while until it's time to sleep. Any peace that I feel belongs to the world.
