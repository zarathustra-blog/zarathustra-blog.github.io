            <h3>Reflections:</h3>
            <p>
Everything is falling away. Now I understand what I came here for: to disintegrate. The old is falling apart, and the new cannot yet be born. 

I have made a resolution of sorts today: in about 6 months, I should have a dip outside of this country. Initially, I resolved to stay here as part of my adhiṭṭhāna, but I would break this resolution only to ask a question and then return. The possibility is there and in about 6 months, it will be adequate to take it. Meanwhile, I remain on my own. After that trip, I may be even more alone, ready for exile after my adhiṭṭhāna here is completed, or I may not be alone at all. Of course, the possibility remains that the question is unanswered, and nothing is resolved. That would probably be the worst-case scenario. But I shall probably make this trip anyway, stay at the monastery for at least a week, and then ask the question. Until then, like Hans Castrop, the best I can do is think that in little time it will be Christmas, after which is already New Year, then the winter, which has not even really begun yet, will start to fade, Easter comes, and my trip is possible. All of it in just a few breaths. 

Coming back to today, I also did not sit for 2 hours. I have even contemplated changing this training precept. What does 2 hours mean? At what time of the day am I not practising, so that I need to differentiate some 2 hours apart from the rest? After all, I still regard meditation as sitting. That is disappointing. I even think that if I did not have this precept, I would meditate even more; my rebellious spirit may be part of the reason why for two or three days in a row now, I have not sat down for two hours. For now, I will let the rule stay. It might be valuable to see how I relate to it.

I have listened to two talks today, amounting to over 4 hours of audio. It was regarding the Organization and presented it in a critical light. I hadn’t heard such perspectives before, which have been arising in me also, and I found it fascinating. There is quite a lot of shaking as a result. I feel more and more distant from the Organization, and this podcast mirrored that experience and gave it an outside ground, as well as some company in whatever comes next. 

I did maintain the other training precepts. 

May this detachment grow into wisdom. Such processes generate much melancholy and sadness in me. It’s now clearer than ever what dukkha is. May that be helpful on the path. May we all be happy.
