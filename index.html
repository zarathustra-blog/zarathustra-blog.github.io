            <h2>Welcome to My Journey</h2>
            <p>This blog will document my journey from October 6, 2024, to July 6, 2025. Each day, I will reflect on the path as I follow these nine precepts:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Abstain from killing, causing the killing, or rejoicing in the killing of any living being.</li>
                <li>Abstain from taking anything that has not been given.</li>
                <li>Abstain from causing harm through speech, including gossip, lying, hiding the truth, or using harsh language.</li>
                <li>Abstain from all sexual conduct.</li>
                <li>Abstain from consuming intoxicants.</li>
                <li>Abstain from any form of entertainment and bodily decoration.</li>
                <li>Follow the one-session practice of eating only in one session.</li>
                <li>Sleep only during the first and second part of the night.</li>
                <li>Meditate for two hours daily.</li>
            </ol>
